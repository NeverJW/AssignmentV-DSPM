I discussed together with Martin Scheerer (ID: 5631373), Michael Lyubkin (ID: 4168485), Lana Kern (ID: 5395819) and Anton HÃ¶hl (ID: 5637078). I assure that my assignment conform to the rules and guidelines in the *Code of Conduct*.

## General Set-up
First of all, I clear the workspace and install the packages that be needed and load the packages.

```{r set_up, message=FALSE}

rm(list = ls())  # clear the workspace

# check if the packages has been installed; if not, then install
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if (!require("xml2")) install.packages("xml2")
if (!require("httr")) install.packages("httr")

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)
library(httr)

```
